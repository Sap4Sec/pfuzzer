# pfuzzer
Dataset and evaluation materials of the Pfuzzer system for fuzzing environment-sensitive malware.

Pfuzzer has been presented in the EuroS&P 2025 paper *"Pfuzzer: Practical, Sound, and Effective Multi-path Analysis of Environment-sensitive Malware with Coverage-guided Fuzzing"* [[PDF](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~delia/papers/eurosp25-pfuzzer.pdf)]. We estimate to release the paper artifacts publicly by October 2025.
